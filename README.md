#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of software systems. Software engineers design, write code, test, debug, and deploy software that addresses real-world problems. Their work powers various industries by creating applications, games, and websites that enhance communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.The importance of software engineering in the technology industry cannot be overstated. It ensures the development of reliable, scalable, and secure software solutions that drive innovation. From automating business processes to enabling global connectivity, software engineering plays a crucial role in advancing technology, improving user experiences, and supporting economic growth.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1960s – The Establishment of Software Engineering as a Discipline
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the "software crisis" caused by increasing complexity in software development. This period marked the beginning of formal methodologies and best practices to improve software quality and maintainability.

1970s – The Advent of Structured Programming
The 1970s saw the rise of structured programming, a paradigm that emphasized clear, logical structures in code using loops, conditionals, and modular design. This approach, championed by figures like Edsger Dijkstra, reduced spaghetti code, making programs easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

2000s – The Rise of Agile Methodologies
The early 2000s saw a shift from rigid, documentation-heavy development methods to Agile methodologies, which prioritized flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. The Agile Manifesto (2001) formalized principles like customer collaboration, continuous delivery, and adaptive planning, leading to frameworks like Scrum and Kanban that dominate modern software development.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Analysis – Developers and stakeholders gather and document functional and non-functional requirements to determine what the software must achieve.

Design – The system architecture, database structure, and user interface are designed based on the requirements. This phase may involve creating wireframes, prototypes, and technical specifications.

Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual code based on the design documents, following best practices to ensure efficiency, maintainability, and security.

Testing – The software undergoes various testing types (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing) to identify and fix bugs before deployment.

Deployment – The tested software is released to users, either through a phased rollout or a full launch, ensuring it functions as intended in a real-world environment.

Maintenance and Support – After deployment, developers provide updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to keep the software secure, efficient, and aligned with evolving user needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile methodologies, unlike the Waterfall approach, follow an iterative and flexible process where development occurs in small, incremental cycles rather than fixed sequential phases. Agile allows for continuous feedback and adaptation, making it ideal for projects where requirements are expected to evolve.
Flexibility: Agile embraces change, enabling modifications even late in development, whereas Waterfall is rigid, making changes costly.
Delivery Speed: Agile delivers working software faster and more frequently, while Waterfall requires all phases to be completed before a final product is delivered.
Client Involvement: Agile promotes frequent stakeholder collaboration, whereas Waterfall involves clients primarily in the early and final stages.
Best Use Cases: Agile is ideal for startups, software products, and dynamic environments where requirements may shift, such as mobile apps, web platforms, and tech-driven businesses.
In summary, Waterfall is suited for stable, high-regulation projects like banking or medical software, while Agile is preferred for fast-changing, customer-driven development like e-commerce sites or SaaS application


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code to build software applications
A QA Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards by testing and identifying bugs and performance issues before deployment.
A Project Manager oversees the software development process, ensuring the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets business objectives.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides tools for writing, testing, and debugging code efficiently. IDEs streamline development by offering features such as code editing provides syntax highlighting, auto completion, and error detection, debugging Tool that allow developers to identify and fix errors easily, Compilation & Execution – Enables running code within the environment without switching tools and project management to help organize files, dependencies, and configurations in one place. IDEs improve developer productivity, reduce errors, and speed up the coding process.
Examples of IDEs include Visual Studio Code for web and software development. JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA for Java development Eclipse for Java and Android development.

A Version Control System (VCS) helps teams track changes in code, collaborate efficiently, and maintain a history of modifications. VCS ensures that developers can. Track code changes Keeps a record of all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions. Enable collaboration between multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s code, Improve Code Stability, Branching and merging allow for safe testing of new features before integrating them into the main project. Version control helps prevent data loss, supports teamwork, and ensures a smooth software development process
Examples of VCS Git that enables collaboration through platforms like GitHub and GitLab. Apache Subversion (SVN) used in enterprise environments. Mercurial fast and scalable alternative to Git, popular in large-scale projects.

Both IDEs and VCS play crucial roles in modern software development IDEs enhance efficiency and reduce development time.VCS ensures collaboration, version tracking, and risk mitigation.
Together, they create a seamless and productive software development workflow.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements, scope creep and project delays during development can lead to delays, increased costs, and frustration, strategies to overcome this challenge include using Agile methodologies to accommodate evolving requirements and Utilize version control sustems like Git  to manage code changes effectively.

Tight Deadlines that lead to rushed development & compromised quality force engineers to cut corners, leading to poorly written code, security flaws, and technical debt. Overcome these chllenges by breaking down tasks using time management techniques to track progress, set realistic deadlines by negotiating with stakeholders and prioritize automated testing to catch bugs early

Technical Debt and Increased maintenance costs from shortcuts and suboptimal solutions, skipping proper documentation or writing messy code leads to long-term maintenance issues and performance bottlenecks. Strategies to overcome these challenges include following coding best practices like code reviews, refactoring, and design patterns to prevent technical debt. Allocate dedicated time in each sprint to clean up code and to make use of automated testing and documentation tools to maintain quality.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing ensures code correctness involves tests on individual componentsor functions of a program in isolation ensuring core functions remain stable, that each function, class, or module works correctly before integration.
Integration testing verifies seamless communication between components.Identifies issues in data flow and interaction between components and prevents failures when combining independently tested units.
System testing checks full functionality to Identify performance, security, and compatibility issues before release.
Acceptance testing conducted by end-users, clients, or business analysts confirms user satisfaction before deployment, this Helps reduce post-launch issues and validates if the software meets business requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting clear, specific, and structured inputs (prompts) to effectively interact with AI models. It involves refining prompts to achieve accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses from AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:"Tell me about planets."

Improved Prompt:"Provide a comparison of Earth, Mars, and Jupiter, focusing on size, atmosphere, and potential for human habitation.

Instead of a broad request it narrows the focus to Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. The prompt has clear intent and specifies that the AI should compare planets and defines key aspects to discuss.
